## Creating a New Access Key

Once you add a new device, you can create an access key that can be used to open the **Phonein Intercom** with your mobile device. 

You can use keys to grant access to your office or residence. For example, you can provide digital keys to a house cleaner or a delivery person while you're away.

> You need to share keys before other people can use them. 

Keys can be one-time, multi-use, or unlimited. They can also be recurring on a regular basis, or valid only on specified dates and times.

### To Create an Unlimited Key

Unlimited keys are ideal for your own use since they remain valid forever. You can also create unlimited keys for other people if you want.

1. On the mobile app's **Home Page**, press **New Key**.
1. On the **New Key** page, enter a key name.
1. Press the **Icon** button and select an applicable category for the key. The default category is ***Friend*** (you can use this if you are creating the key for your own use). The other key categories are ***Customer***, ***Services***, ***Event***, ***Delivery***, ***Renter***, and ***Employee***.

## Using a Key to Unlock and Open a Door

You can unlock doors using the access keys generated from the Phonein mobile app. For example, you can generate a key for your house and another for your office. When you're on your walking to your door, you can already unlock it by tapping the assigned key on the mobile app instead of fishing out your physical keys out from your bag or purse.

If you only generated a single key, it will be prominently displayed on the mobile app's **Welcome** page. Press the key to open a door. 

You can also retrieve a key by pressing the **Keys** tab, then tapping on it from the list.

Guests must download and install the appropriate Phonein mobile app for their devices to use your shared keys and let themselves inside the assigned location.

You can allow a key to open an inner door by enabling the **Also Opens Inner Door** option when you create the key.
