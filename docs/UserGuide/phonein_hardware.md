## Parts of the Hardware

When you unbox your Phonein Intercom, you will notice a set of buttons on the front of the hardware. These buttons have the following functions:

* <img src="/img/icon_wifi.jpg" width="25" /> Wifi Reset: Press and hold for two (2) seconds.
* <img src="/img/icon_update.jpg" width="25" /> Update / Factory Reset: Press to check for updates. Press and hold for 10 seconds to reset to factory version.
* <img src="/img/icon_answer.jpg" width="25" /> Answer / Open: Answer the call, then open the door.
* <img src="/img/icon_end.jpg" width="25" /> Reject: Reject access.
* <img src="/img/icon_down.jpg" width="25" /> Volume Down
* <img src="/img/icon_up.jpg" width="25" /> Volume Up
* <img src="/img/icon_reset.jpg" width="25" /> Reboot / Wake Up

<!-- There is some additional text for each of these. For instance, I would like to talk about the wifi reset procedure which is rather lengthy. Also fo rthe Answer / Open, I'd like to talk more about when each one happens. And for volume Up / Down, it depends on which mode the Phonein is in. 

Where should we include this extra text? Can we link them each to their own section?

If you create those areas in the documentation, I can fill them in, as it's rather detailed.  -->
