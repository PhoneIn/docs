## How do I install it?

> Phonein is designed to be easy to install. Do it yourself in about 10 minutes! No Need to contact your building manager.<br /><br />Just replace your existing building intercom system with Phonein, use our app to set it up, and you’re good to go.<br /><br />See our section on installation here: [Installation Overview](/InstallationGuide/overview)

## Can people use Phonein if they don’t have the app downloaded?

> Yes! A key shared from Phonein does not need the application to be activated. The app is only needed by the owner to speak through the intercom and create and share keys.

## How do I know when my guests have entered the building?

> When a guests uses a key to enter the building the owner will get a push notification telling them which key was used.

## Can I set keys for weeks in advance?

> Absolutely, the keys can be configured with a start date and an end date. Using these settings you can feel safe creating a key weeks or months ahead of time. These dates can always be changed later as well.

## Can I change the settings of a key after I shared it with my guests?

> Yes! You can modify or revoke a key at any time.

## Is Phonein safe?

> Because Phonein sends you notifications when a key is used, and because keys expire just when you want (after a certain amount of time, or number of uses), a shared Phonein key is MORE SAFE than sharing a physical key or sharing a code! So is it safe?? We sure think so!

## Do I need permission from the house manager if I want to use Phonein?

> We wish we could give an absolute ‘no,’ but every situation and contract is different. Since the device only sits inside the apartment, you can add it just like you were replacing the existing intercom phone.

## What happens if the electricity goes out in the building? Can they still enter with Phonein?

> If the power goes out in your apartment, some of Phonein’s features will likely stop working. This is because the wifi is needed to see if a key has been activated, or to forward the intercom call to your mobile phone. However, because the Phonein has a battery installed, it will still ring and function locally as your old intercom phone did.<br /><br />If the power to the whole building is out, this often affects the intercom system entirely, in which case Phonein won’t be useful until the power comes back. When the power returns the device will automatically reconnect to everything needed.
