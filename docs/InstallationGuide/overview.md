## Installation Overview

**Phonein Intercom** is the Phonein hardware that is installed inside your residence/office. In most cases, it will fully replace your intercom phone. With Phonein you will have all the functionality of your old intercom, including being able to speak to the guest and buzz them in directly from the device, but also you have the additional smart features used from your smart phone.

## Purchasing the Hardware
You may purchase Phonein from https://www.phonein.io/buy.

## What you'll find in the Box?

Your Phonein hardware comes with the following:
- The Phonein Device:
    - On the back you’ll find the QR code, necessary for activating your device.
- Wall mount: 
    - With this you can install your PhoneIn on the wall.
    - You can use the sticky tape on the back of the wall mount piece, but we recommend using screws for a secure installation. You can find these in the box as well.
- Wall charger: 
    - Phonein has an internal battery, so you don’t need to leave it plugged in to the wall. However, the device is faster if it’s powered through the charger, so if you can leave it plugged in, that’s even better and we recommend it!
- Connectors:
    - You will find two green connectors.
        - The one with the rainbow coloured sticker is for connecting to the doorphone.
        - The other connector is only needed if you want to use an external power supply, or you have a strikelock.
    - There is also some extra wire, a little screwdriver and some electrical tape, which you can use during the install.
## WARNING!
This version of PhoneIn is a beta device, which means that it’s still under development.
We work very hard, to make it better and better, so if you experience any problems with your Phonein device, please contact us at contact@phonein.io

## Parts of the Hardware

When you unbox your Phonein Intercom, you will notice a set of buttons on the front of the hardware. These buttons have the following functions:
<!-- I think this section about the buttons of the Phonein device should be in another section about using the Phonein, rather than installing, sound good or what do you think? -->

<!-- Would be good to include images of the icons. I can provide those. -->

* <img src="/img/icon_wifi.jpg" width="50" /> Wifi Reset: Press and hold for two (2) seconds.
* <img src="/img/icon_update.jpg" width="50" /> Update / Factory Reset: Press to check for updates. Press and hold for 10 seconds to reset to factory version.
* <img src="/img/icon_answer.jpg" width="50" /> Answer / Open: Answer the call, then open the door.
* <img src="/img/icon_end.jpg" width="50" /> Reject: Reject access.
* <img src="/img/icon_down.jpg" width="50" /> Volume Down
* <img src="/img/icon_up.jpg" width="50" /> Volume Up
* <img src="/img/icon_reset.jpg" width="50" /> Reboot / Wake Up

<!-- There is some additional text for each of these. For instance, I would like to talk about the wifi reset procedure which is rather lengthy. Also fo rthe Answer / Open, I'd like to talk more about when each one happens. And for volume Up / Down, it depends on which mode the Phonein is in. 

Where should we include this extra text? Can we link them each to their own section?

If you create those areas in the documentation, I can fill them in, as it's rather detailed.  -->
