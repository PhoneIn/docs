## 4+n wiring guide

- Connecting to a 4+n type analog system is easy, but it's unique for each different doorphone system.
- You need to find documentation for your specific doorphone by its part number, and figure out, which connection serves what purpose in your specific case.
- Once you have that, you can just simply connect the wires to their respective terminals on the green connector, as explained below:

- D1 – door opening pin
- D2 – should go to either GND or to a power supply, depending on how the door opens. (if the door opens when its pin is pulled to gnd, this port should go to gnd as well)
- C – Call detection line
- AI – Audio in
- AO – Audio out
- G – GND
- 2, 2 – These are used in a BUS system, ignore these for 4+n systems.

- If you're stuck, or can't find the necessary information about your system, contact us at [Phonein customer support](mailto:contact@phonein.io), and we'll help you with the setup process!
