## 4+n wiring guide

D1 – door opening pin
D2 – should go to either GND or to a power supply, depending on how the door opens. (if the door opens when its pin is pulled to gnd, this port should go to gnd as well)
C – Call detection line
AI – audio in (this most likely won’t work on this system, so please don’t connect it)
AO – audio out (this most likely won’t work on this system, so please don’t connect it)
G – GND
2, 2 – These are used in a BUS system, so igonre these now.
