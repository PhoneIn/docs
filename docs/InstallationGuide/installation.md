# Installing the Phonein Intercom

You can use your Phonein Intercom either by replacing the old intercom, or setting Phonein up parallel to the old phone, so both of them work at the same time!


# Installation steps

1. Open your old intercom!
    1. Usually these intercoms are held together by screws, unscrew these to open the old intercom.
    2. If you don’t see any screws, you try inserting a screwdriver into the seam on the side of the intercom, and gently prying it open.
2. Take pictures of the inside of your intercom now!
    1. If you need to move things back for any reason, this picture will help you remember what goes where.
    2. Make sure you have clear pictures of the wires, and where they connect to the old intercom!
3. Locate the wires coming from the wall!
    1. In most of the cases, you’ll see either 2 or 5 wires coming from the wall, and connecting to the handset. The install flow will be the same for both cases.
    2. BE CAREFUL! You are working with an electric device. Make sure that you don’t touch the non insulated part of the wires, and you don’t let the wires touch each other! The best practice is, if you add a little electrical tape to the wire ends until you need them.
4. Decision time!
    1. If you want to replace your old intercom with Phonein:
        1. Remove the wires from the terminal.
        2. Remove the old intercom from the wall
    2. If you want to set up your Phonein parallel to the old intercom:
        1. Add the supplied extra wires right next to the existing ones, inside the terminal on your old intercom.
        2. Lead the new wire out (there usually is a little place for it, where the handset wire exits the housing)
        3. Close the old intercom.
5. Install the Phonein wall mount!
    1. You can use the sticky tape on the wall mount, but for a secure installation, we recommend screwing it to the wall, with the provided screws.
6. Add the connector to the free wires
    1. Make sure, you use the connector with the rainbow coloured sticker! The other one is the power connector, you don’t need it now.
    2. If it’s a 2 wire system, connect the two wires to the purple terminal places, with the number 2 written on them. The polarity doesn’t matter!
    3. If it’s a 5 wire system, please read the wire guide, which will explain which wire goes where in the connector. These wires are NOT interchangeable.
7. Plug in the connector into the Phonein
    1. Make sure you match the colours found on the connector and the Phonein case.
8. Place your Phonein on the wall mount piece
    1. The Phonein has a little compartment on the back, where you can hide the excess wires.

DONE!
