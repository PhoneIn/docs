# What is PhoneIn?
PhoneIn is a universal smart intercom system that is compatible with building door security systems. 

PhoneIn has three (3) parts:

1. The PhoneIn intercom, or hardware
2. The PhoneIn mobile apps for Android and iOS

Once you have installed a PhoneIn device in your office or residence, you can open your door using your mobile device. You can also use PhoneIn to allow guests or employees access to your building or residence/office.

This website is the repository for all **PhoneIn** documentation. Here, you can find the PhoneIn Intercom Installation Guide and the PhoneIn User Guide for Android and iOS Users.

# Use Cases

PhoneIn comes in handy in many cases:

ðŸ“±âš¡ You have an appointment at home, but unfortunately, you have to leave urgently for a short time. Your guest can enter the building even if you arrive back in 30 minutes, so he doesn't have to wait outside.  
ðŸ“±âš¡ Your kid lost his keys today, but you are still working. If you installed PhoneIn, you can give him access and he can let himself in with the app right away.  
ðŸ“±âš¡ You forgot the appointment with the housekeeper and she can't enter the building because you're not home. Instead of rushing there, send her a link in SMS.  
ðŸ“±âš¡ Your online orders will be in front of your door every single time.

# Requirements
Before purchasing a PhoneIn Intercom, make sure that:

* Your building allows installation of a new, or replacement of its existing, intercom system, if any
* You have access to a locksmith, if you don't feel comfortable tinkering with your existing intercom system. If you want to connect your PhoneIn with a strike lock, get a locksmith who can also work with electric locks.
* You have either an Android or iOS mobile device that you can use with the system.
